                <p>My name is Nicolas Nogueira. I was born and raised in Framingham, Massachusetts. My parents are immigrants from Brazil, which makes me a first-generation American, and I am very proud of my Brazilian heritage. My culture has influenced my values, particularly my great appreciation for family, friendship, and hard work.</p>
                <p>I am inherently curious and have always been interested in technology and innovation. A part of this curiosity began at a young age, my uncle has been working at Apple since I was a kid, and he enjoys telling the story of how I used to crawl into his room just to play with his computers. Being exposed to him and witnessing his passion for technology ignited something in me from a young age. Due to this passion, I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Stonehill College with minors in Business and Data Analysis, and I am set to graduate in 2027. I am particularly interested in the area of technology and strategy, how technology can create impact.</p>
                <p>Academically, I am interested in many things. However, outside of academics, I enjoy being outdoors and staying active. Soccer has been a huge part of my life since I was a kid. Soccer has influenced my work ethic, leadership skills, and competitive nature, and it will always be a big part of who I am. Soccer has taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and testing my personal limits.</p>
                <p>Overall, I strive to combine my cultural roots, intellectual curiosity, and passion for growth into everything I pursue.</p>
